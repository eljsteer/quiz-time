Quiz Application for Testing Javascript Fundamentals
## Software Application summary
This software is a quiz game that will test your knowledge of Javascript with computer science and javascript based questions. You will be scored by the time remaining left on the timer once the user has finished answering all the questions.

## Inspiration

I had the inspiration to build the Quiz Game application in order to further develop my javascript skills and practice with using web APIs. 

## Updates

I initially updated a standard html template to incorporate the quiz layout and sections. I added the rules to the game and developed a start button to initiate the quiz.
I then created the timer function and called the function in the start button.
I created an array of objects which contained all the questions and answers.
Had some assistance from Sandesh and Nathan in developing the method to display the questions and answers and then cycle through them.
I created a function to test the answer against the option that the user chose. Then added conditional elements to cycle to the next question if correct or deduct 10secs off the timer if the answer selected was incorrect.
Created conditionals to determine when the quiz is finished by either end of questions or timer reaching 0.
Added a huge amount of data attribute adjustments once user clicks on different elements and starts different parts of the quiz game to show and hide different sections and buttons.
Added basic css formatting and styling.
Commented sections of my code in html, css and js files to breakup and distinguish easier the segments of code.
update of file names and links to allow github to display the website while changing repository anem to lowercase and also removing the #'s on the start of the html files.

## Skills and Knowledge learned

I learned a lot from all aspects on this project also, particularly on the design and methodology.

The most important thing I learnt which was reinforced was the importance of building one section at a time and sequentially move onto the next section only once that section is working.
I solidified my knowledge around changing and setting data attributes on elements in HTML. I also 
I further developed my knowlesge around functions and how they work and layout of lines of code whether to include in the function or outside.
Further developed upon my knowledge around conditional statements as this project required a lot more logic especially when I reduced the index pages to jsut having one page and needing to show and hide the different elements or have them all interact correctly.
Learn a lot on how to store items in local storage and the complicated features of this with alternating between strings and arrays with storing and drawing on the data.
I feel my overall knowledge of javascript and building has definitely improved and putting functions together with different logic has improved, although still struggle with the design side and determining the easiest way to build the application
